# Super Simple Cloudflare Deployment Guide ðŸš€

## What We're Doing:
Your website has 2 parts:
1. **Frontend** (the pretty website people see) â†’ Goes on Cloudflare Pages
2. **Backend** (the database and AI stuff) â†’ Goes on Railway (separate service)

Think of it like this: Your website is the store, but the cash register is in a different building.

---

## STEP 1: Get Your Website Files Ready (5 minutes)

### 1.1 Build your website
**Where to do this:** Right here in Replit!

Look at the bottom of your screen - you should see a black box (that's the terminal/console). If you don't see it, look for a tab that says "Console" or "Shell" and click it.

In that black box, type this and press Enter:
```bash
npm run build
```

Wait for it to finish (you'll see some text scroll by, then it will stop and show you a new line to type on).

### 1.2 Find your files
Look on the left side of Replit in your file list. You should now see:
- A folder called `dist` â†’ click to open it
- Inside `dist`, there's a folder called `public` 
- The `public` folder contains your entire website files!

**What you need:** Everything inside the `dist/public` folder - these are the files you'll upload to Cloudflare.

## STEP 2: Set Up Cloudflare Pages (10 minutes)

### 2.1 Create a Cloudflare account
1. Go to https://pages.cloudflare.com
2. Click "Sign up" (it's free!)
3. Use your email and create a password
4. Verify your email when they send you one

### 2.2 Create your first Pages project
1. Once logged in, click the big blue "Create a project" button
2. Choose "Upload assets"
3. Give your project a name like `roto-lighting-website`
4. Click "Create project"

### 2.3 Upload your website
1. Remember that `dist/public` folder? We need to upload everything inside it
2. You can either:
   - **Option A**: Drag all the files from `dist/public` into the upload box
   - **Option B**: Click "Select from computer" and choose all files in `dist/public`
3. Click "Deploy site"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes... â˜•

ðŸŽ‰ **Your website is now live!** You'll get a URL like `roto-lighting-website.pages.dev`

---

## STEP 3: Set Up Your Database & API (15 minutes)

Your website looks pretty, but the contact forms and blog won't work yet. We need to set up the "backend."

### 3.1 Set up a database (Supabase - Free)
1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Click "Start your project" then "Sign up" (free account)
3. Click "New project"
4. Choose any organization name, project name like "Roto Lighting DB"
5. Create a database password (save this password!)
6. Choose a region close to you
7. Click "Create new project" and wait 2-3 minutes
8. **IMPORTANT**: Once it's ready, click "Connect" button at the top
9. Choose "Connection string" â†’ "Transaction pooler" 
10. Copy the URI that looks like:
    ```
    postgresql://postgres.something:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
    ```
11. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with the password you created in step 5
12. Save this complete connection string somewhere safe!

### 3.2 Set up your API server (Railway - Free)
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Start a New Project"
3. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. If you don't have GitHub yet:
   - Go to https://github.com
   - Sign up for free
   - Come back to Railway

### 3.3 Put your code on GitHub (if not done already)
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click the green "New" button
3. Name it `roto-lighting-website`
4. Make it public
5. Click "Create repository"
6. Follow the instructions to upload your code (or ask me to help with this step)

### 3.4 Deploy to Railway
1. Back on Railway, connect your GitHub account
2. Choose your `roto-lighting-website` repository
3. Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js project
4. Click "Deploy"

### 3.5 Add your secrets to Railway
1. In Railway, go to your project
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Add these secrets one by one (click "New Variable" for each):
   ```
   DATABASE_URL = [paste that long database URL from Neon]
   OPENAI_API_KEY = [your OpenAI key]
   BREVO_API_KEY = [your email key]
   PEXELS_API_KEY = [your image key]
   SESSION_SECRET = [type any random text like: mySecretPassword123]
   NODE_ENV = production
   ```

## STEP 4: Connect Everything (5 minutes)

### 4.1 Get your Railway URL
1. In Railway, your project will have a URL like `https://something-something.railway.app`
2. Copy this URL

### 4.2 Tell Cloudflare where your API is
1. Go back to your Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Settings" â†’ "Environment variables"
4. Add a new variable:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL = https://your-railway-url.railway.app
   ```
5. Click "Save"

### 4.3 Update your database
1. In Railway, go to "Deployments"
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click "View Logs"
4. In the logs, you should see it running
5. Run the database setup by going to your Railway URL + `/api/setup` in your browser

---

## STEP 5: Test Everything (2 minutes)

1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages URL (the one that ends in `.pages.dev`)
2. Try filling out the contact form
3. Try subscribing to the newsletter
4. Go to `/admin` and try logging in with: `rotolighting` / `Heiko123!`

If something doesn't work, check:
- Are all your environment variables set correctly?
- Is your Railway app running? (check the logs)
- Did you add the `/api/setup` step?

---

- **Cloudflare Pages**: Free (up to 1GB, 500k requests/month)
- **Railway**: Free (up to $5/month usage, then pay-as-you-go)
- **Neon Database**: Free (up to 3GB, then $20/month)
